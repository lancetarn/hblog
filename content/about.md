I'm a human, like some potential parsers of this content. My career has had an
IT thread for more than a decade and I just keep on adding strands. I've worked for
small business and worn a few different hats, as one does in that context. I find that
 generalizing offers a wonderous variety; I love it most when it still offers an
opportunity to hone a skill towards mastery. I've done
a bit of web application development and a bit of opertions. I like making things
that people can use. I like making the things that people use reliable. I like
writing code, maybe a little too much. 

That's more "I" than should ever be in one paragraph. On to more important things.
